# File: history.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "player history" information for 
# the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Background information:
# Pieces of player backstory are chosen from "charts", which are lists of
# phrases or sentences with similar general meaning.

# 'chart' lines give the number of the current chart, the number of the chart
# that will be used next (or 0 if the last chart), and a cutoff for choosing
# the current line.  If the first field in two chart lines is the same, the
# second should be as well, to maintain consistent choices and end up with
# something readable.

# 'phrase' lines are the actual chart entries which make up the history.

# Chart progression by race:
#   Human         -->  1 -->  2 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Android       28 .. 36
#   Time-Lord     37 .. 40

# This table *must* be correct or the history may look very silly.

# Note that the "spacing" in the "description" lines is very important!
