# quest.txt

# This file contains the fixed (and only) quests.  The current system is that
# a copy of these is made into the player data at birth, and the level field
# in that copy is zeroed when the quest is completed.  This system could be
# improved; it could also be easily adapted to add more fixed quests (by adding
# to this file).  It would also only require fairly small game code changes to
# allow other quests to be added as a result of game events.

name:Rats
level:6
race:giant grey rat
number:12
store:Stores:Convenience Store
entrymin:2
entrymax:5
entryfeature:permanent wall
intro:There's a cellar out back. It's full of rats. Are you up for cleaning them out?
desc:Deal with the rats in the cellar
succeed:So you've cleaned them out? Great. Maybe some day Nijel - who is not exactly a little kid any more after all - will learn to muck out his own pets. But as you clearly care about animals I hope you will appreciate some rat treats along with the $200 cash.
failure:So you were defeated by a mouse? How heroic! Brave Sir Robin would be proud.
unlock:Whiskey Cave

name:Whiskey Cave
level:15
object:bottle
store:Rats
entryfeature:lava
#12 generated - more rewards if you return more than 6
min-found:6
max-remaining:0
intro:Well, I guess I can trust you now. I thought I was being clever, using a small cave that I thought nobody knew about to store my stash of valuable rare spirits safely. It's by the volcanic vent. Unfortunately the roof collapsed - I really didn't expect that! Could you dig your way in and retrieve it for me? You'll be rewarded, and not just with a few bottle caps this time. I would take digging equipment of some kind - I don't know how far back the collapse went.
desc:Retrieve the rare booze from the volcanic cave
succeed:Thanks a lot. As promised I have $200 per bottle for you.
failure:It was all lost? That's a shame.
flags:locked

#succeed:Well done. A reward? Isn't the thrill of exploration its own reward? No? Well, OK.

name:Msing Pills
level:15
object:pill
store:Fortress:Pharmacy
entrymin:20
# You must pick up every pill you can see (max-remaining 0) and return a reasonable number (of the ~200) but if there is some accidental destruction that's OK.
min-found:120
max-remaining:0
intro:Most of my stock has been stolen. I don't know who did it, or where they have been taken - I couldn't get a straight answer from the witness. He just babbled on about a glowing maze filled with ghosts - he must have popped a few pills himself! But you will be well rewarded if you can bring it all back.
desc:Find the pills and return them to the pharmacy
succeed:Well done - you are going to like these, I'm sure.
failure:Oh well - I realise that I didn't give you much to go on.

name:Soldier, Sailor, Chef, Pie
level:11
object:card
store:Mine:Convenience Store
store:Caverns:Convenience Store
min-found:1
max-remaining:0
intro:My baking is famous across dozens of vaults, and it's all down to my secret recipe. Nobody's managed to reproduce it, and believe me they have tried! But those snakes at the Black Market don't want to even attempt that - instead their agent deceived my young assistant, switching our one master copy of the recipe with junk. The agent slipped away underground, and is probably some way down by now. If you could get the recipe back for me before she breaks cover and takes it to the Black Market, I would be very grateful!
desc:Find the Black Market's agent, return the recipe
succeed:Here's the last batch and - if you can keep it quiet - the secret ingredients!
failure:So why did I trust you again?

name:Hunter, in Darkness
level:25
race:wumpus
number:1
entryfeature:granite wall
store:Soldier, Sailor, Chef, Pie:Black Market
intro:No, you aren't seeing the good stuff. That's not for everyone. Go kill something big to show us you aren't all talk. There's a wumpus in the bat cave. That would do nicely.
desc:Hunt the Wumpus
succeed:The traditional wumpus hunter's prize isn't worth much, but I think you'll like this boomstick!
failure:Well, I saw you walking boldly into the wumpus's den - so I will admit that although you didn't manage to defeat it, you aren't just a poseur. So I'll reluctantly allow you in to see more stuff, but you can't expect a real reward. You do still get the traditional wumpus hunter's prize, though, for what that's worth.

# The rest is dynamic
name:Hit List
store:All:Black Market
succeed:Congratulations - here's your reward.
failure:It appears that someone else got there first, so there's no reward. That doesn't stop you from taking another contract though, if one is available.
desc:The Black Market maintains a list of contract killings. Accept the job, eliminate your target and you'll get increasingly valuable rewards and the option to take a more challenging target. Successful assassins also command respect in the mob and you'll be able to buy higher level stuff at better prices.

name:Arena
store:All:Black Market
succeed:Luck's with you today! Here's your payout. 
failure:Oh well, you can't win every time. Try again tomorrow maybe?
desc:The Black Market runs regular fights. You can bet on them or participate yourself. Come on if you think you're hard enough!

name:Day of the Triffids
level:35
race:triffid
number:20
store:Fortress:Weapon Dealer
flags:town
intro:The town has been overrun by some seriously invasive species. A venomous shrubbery doesn't sound very plausible, I know. But I've seen it myself - the horrible thing just grabbed Ned in its tongue, pulled him in and bit his head clean off!
desc:Eliminate all the triffids in town
succeed:Congratulations. We're all grateful - I'll see if I can arrange better prices for you around town, and I can supply you with some valuable specialized ammunition as a reward.
failure:Well, it seems that someone has got rid of our weed problem. But while you may have contributed, you didn't stick around and finish the job yourself so you won't be getting the reward.

name:Swimming with Meg
level:50
race:megalodon
number:1
store:Lake:Armoury
flags:town
intro:I keep hearing that there's a huge shark in the pond. People are even taking bets on when it will next show up and who's going to be the next victim. Well, I for one don't believe a word of it - how could it even get in there? They can't fly, after all. But I would have to do something obvious to convince anyone and collect on the bet - so if you could go and splash about a bit, chummer?
desc:Check out the lake
succeed:Well, OK, so there *was* a shark in there. But there isn't any more, and I think that's good enough for me to collect my winnings even if it isn't what I was expecting. You'll get your share of the winnings anyway.
failure:So there *was* a shark in there, but it got away? I'm not arguing, but the trouble is that without any evidence one way or the other the bet is still going to remain open and we aren't going to get anything.

name:Rooms+Shrooms
level:4
race:mushroom
store:Stores:Home
desc:Well, yes. Nobody's stopping you staying there - if you can deal with all the mushrooms growing through the floor. Me, no thanks.
flags:home

name:Wasps
level:9
race:wasps' nest
race:Beraban wasp
store:Sewers:Home
desc:There's nothing much wrong with the empty house, except the huge wasps' nest in there. And these aren't normal wasps, mind - they're huge great things, and so far everyone has taken one look at them and legged it. I've also heard someone claim that they explode, although that may have just have been an excuse for running away...
flags:home

name:Cyberspace
level:15
race:cyberpsycho
race:cyber-enthusiast
race:cyborg
store:Mine:Home
desc:The usual cyber-enthusiasts aren't usually exactly threatening. More annoying. Except when there's a complete nut-job shooting up the town and they are all convinced that the sun shines out of his shiny metal ass. Scrap him and you can use their place yourself.
flags:home

name:Checkpoint X
level:20
race:Bigtrak
race:hologram
race:mailworm
race:talky
race:mine
store:Fortress:Home
desc:Entry to the Fortress was originally secured by armed guards based at a small fortified building on the surface close to the way in. The entrance hasn't been actively guarded for years, but the checkpoint's automated defences remain. The reports I have heard are pretty sketchy, but you can probably expect to have to deal with landmines, killer robots and holograms.
flags:home

name:Lost World
level:30
race:velociraptor
race:deinonychus
race:archaeopteryx
race:tyrannosaur
race:diplodocus
store:Caverns:Home
desc:The previous occupant of the Cavern Club kept some unusual pets. Then one bit him in two. We'd all be grateful if you could stop them grazing on our customers. You could even use the place yourself.
flags:home

name:Huggy Bears
level:38
race:xenomorph
race:facehugger
store:Volcano:Home
desc:There's something scary in there. A team of Space Marines went in there with plasma rifles blazing and just as quickly made a tactical retreat, carrying one of them back with something ugly hugging his face.
