### Understanding chest.txt ###

# When a chest is opened, a % is rolled and compared to all themes' "from" for
# that chest's name. If it matches, that theme is selected - if none do then the
# 'good' theme (random good items) is used?

# The theme then generates random items from the list of tval or items (if these
# do not sum to 100, the rest are random items). Containers can never be produced,
# or anything too heavy, or more than a limited number.


# name: name (of a theme)
# switch:<chance>:	Chance of this theme causing a switch to another theme rather than another item from this one
# type: tval [ : scale ]
# item: tval : sval [ : scale ]
# from:<chance>:<container name>:	This container has this % chance of generating this theme.
# rarity:<multiplier> Reduce the chance of being generated by this factor
# level:<level>	Compared to the level it was generated at, increase or reduce generation
# maxlevel:<level> Never generate below this
# minlevel:<level> or above this

# 'type' is for possible tvals (object bases).  A 'type' line indicates
# that any object kind of that type can be used to generate this ego-item.

# 'item' is for possible tval-sval pairs, which correspond to object kinds.
# One or more 'item' lines are used when we don't want all object kinds of
# this tval to be possible for this ego-item.
# The sval may be preceded by a '!', in which case the object kind is removed.
# This is used when all kinds of a type except that one are wanted. In this
# case, the 'type' line must precede the 'item' line.

# Either of the above may be followed by 'scale', which multiplies all
# probabilities, biasing selection of a base item for this ego towards these
# items.
# Cash, etc. Gold block? Anything over a value-by-level?
