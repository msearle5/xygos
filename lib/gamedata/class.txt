# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new class.

# 'stats' is for the stat modifiers - strength, intelligence, wisdom,
# dexterity, constitution.

# 'skill-<skill name>' is for skills - physical and magical disarming,
# magic devices, saving throws, stealth, to hit (normal), to hit (bows),
# to hit (throwing), digging.  The base entry is what gets added to the
# character's skills at birth, the increments are added to the base skill
# every ten levels.

# 'hitdie' is for additional average hitpoints gained at maximum level.

# 'exp' is for percent of "standard" experience needed to gain a level.

# 'info' is for extra info - max. hitpoints gained per level, experience
# factor in percent.

# 'exp' sets the classes additive contribution, in percent, to the experience
# point penalty.  The original classes don't set this and get the default of
# no experience point penalty.

# 'max-attacks' sets the maximum possible number of blows per round.

# 'min-weight' is the minimum, in tenths of pounds, imposed on a weapon's weight
# when computing the number of blows per round.

# 'strength-multiplier' is the multiplier for strength's contribution to the
# number of blows per round; a bigger value grants more blows.

# 'equip' is for starting equipment - tval of the item, sval of the item,
# minimum amount, maximum amount, names of birth options separated by spaces
# or | (or none for no exclusion rules) which will exclude the item if set
# (or, if the name of the option is preceded by NOT-, will exclude the item if
# not set).

# 'level-from' is the first level which the following flags apply to

# 'obj-flags' is for object properties (from object_property.txt) that the
# class has.

# 'player-flags' is for player properties (from player_property.txt) that the
# class has.

# 'title' is for class titles.
# There can be any number of them - max 12 chars if possible (13 would mean
# overlapping the blank space on the char sheet and mani display, more won't
# be seen.)

# 'magic' is for general magic info - level of the first spell, weight that
# hurts spells, number of books used.

# 'book' names the following techniques as being part of a book. This is
# not an actual object, just a way of classifying techniques.

# 'spell' defines an individual spell - name, level, mana required,
# fail-rate, experience for first casting, optional failure message.
# 'spell:' lines always refer to spells in the previous 'book:' line.
# The lines below are all used in reference to the previous 'spell:' line.

# 'effect' defines the spell effect (as listed in src/list-effects.h),
# and optionally parameters for effect subtype, effect radius and
# an extra parameter for various things

# 'effect-yx' sets the y (i.e. vertical) range and x (i.e. horizontal) range
# about the effect's centre.  Only some effects (often detections) use those
# ranges.

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'seffect-msg' provides a message which can be used in whatever way the effect
# needs, typically to print during the effect, or as a death message.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the spell. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.

cdesc:A civilian weapon expert, reasonably skilled with all ranged weapons and the best of any role with your chosen specialty. Being used to firing at paper targets which rarely fire back though, your melee combat and stealth are not so hot. You'll recognize guns and ammo up to your level in Marksman.

cdesc:It sounds crazy at first - to fight only with bare hands and in your skivvies to boot. But with the right training it works surprisingly well, though you'll still be hoping for a green belt (as in mil-spec forcefield kit) and similar unencumbering protection.

cdesc:A master of deception, misdirection and custard pies. You can perform impressive card tricks and are a great shot with a thrown knife or more exotic weapons (it's always best to kill your enemies in a humorous way, after all). And when it turns out that you shouldn't have brought a pie to a gun fight, some useful athletic techniques may speed your escape.

seffect:TIMED_INC:RARE_CARD

spell:Pantomime Cow:17:30:30:5:0:3d200
seffect:SHAPECHANGE:cow
sdesc:Take the shape of a cow. (Don't ask me how you mimic a cow.) This makes you considerably stronger and tougher, difficult to stun or confuse and resistant to shards. Unfortunately cows are also clumsy, noisy and not very bright.

sdesc:Take the shape of a horse, and run with it! As well as speed this makes you stronger and tougher, difficult to stun or confuse and resistant to shards. Unfortunately horses are also clumsy, noisy and not very bright.

spell:Pantomime Crocodile:33:30:300:5:0:3d500
seffect:SHAPECHANGE:crocodile
sdesc:Take the shape of a crocodile - that's the way to do it! A very effective and stealthy fighter, strong and tough, difficult to stun or confuse and resistant to shards. Without major disadvantages, but you are still a little dumber and clumsier.

spell:Pantomime Elephant:37:30:350:5:0:3d600
seffect:SHAPECHANGE:elephant
sdesc:Take the shape of a elephant, and stomp through anything! Stronger, tougher and better protected than any other form and doubly resistant to shards, the elephant can fight well but is clumsy, slow and very noisy.

spell:Deus ex Asinus:40:0:1000:5:0:1000000000
sdesc:With this technique you can pull something completely unjustified out of your ass. But you can only get away with something so brazen once! This can be complete healing, massive destruction (radius 20), mass genocide (this has a hitpoint cost), a missile strike (1600 damage, radius 5) or altering reality (replacing the level).

You can also avoid pits, lava and similar hazards but must be aware that a jet engine wakes the heaviest sleepers. Later you'll be able to upgrade to a fighter, equipped with a plasma cannon.

sdesc:When next to a rock face, climb up it to the level above. 
sdesc:Failing can hurt - Feather Falling is recommended.

cdesc:You are trained and equipped for underground exploration, can avoid falls and will gain powerful abilities to dig, climb, map, detect and find hidden passages. Your combat ability is middling - fitness helps but only so much without having practiced much. However you can become an effective tactical fighter through your positioning abilities.

You also excel with printers and item related cards, and will gain a few skills to use items in unexpected ways.

spell:Upgrade:22:20:80:1:0:2d80
seffect:BRAND_ITEM
sdice:3+1d4
sdesc:Attempts to make a non-ego into an ego item. On a non-ego base item it will almost always succeed, although the results can't be predicted. Rarely, it will add multiple egos. It can be run against an ego item in order to create a multiple ego, but this doesn't often work and risks destroying it.

spell:Inject Fault:24:45:90:1:0:2d20
seffect:ADD_FAULT
sdesc:Attempt to add a fault to an item. (A few faults can be useful in their own right, but the real reason to use this is Troubleshoot's lag bolts.)

spell:Service:28:50:150:1:0:2d100
seffect:REMOVE_FAULTS
sdice:60+d40
sdesc:Attempt to remove all faults from an item, with greater chance of success than Troubleshoot (like the difference between major-repair and repair cards)

seffect:UNBRAND_ITEM
sdesc:Attempts to remove all additions, positive and negative, from a piece of equipment - to-hit and -dam, egos, activations, faults and so on. Even artifacts will lose everything which makes them special, with no volcano needed.

sdesc:Transforms an item into a powerful artifact. Be aware that artifacts are unique; only one artifact made by your own hands may exist, whether or not it was built using this technique. The item may be any equippable item type, so long as it is not already an artifact or ego-item. Also watch out for the explosive side effects - you should be at full health and away from anything you care about!
