skill-device:0
skill-save:0
skill-stealth:0
skill-search:0
skill-melee:0
skill-martial:0
skill-shoot:0
skill-throw:0
skill-dig:0
desc:An average personality with no further changes made. This is the simplest and not a bad choice for any character, so if you don't want to care about personalities this is the one to go for. However it will rarely be the best choice, either - most classes benefit from enhancing their positive characteristics or (less often) shoring up their weak points. 

personality:Geeky

skill-save:-10
skill-stealth:-5
skill-search:-10
skill-melee:-15
skill-martial:-5
skill-shoot:-5
skill-throw:-5
skill-dig:-5
desc:You are intelligent, curious and have acquired much background knowledge of pre-War equipment and such esoterica - but at a cost to combat skills, physical stats and hitpoints. It's an obvious choice for an Engineer, reinforcing that class's strong points - but it can also be used with other classes that would benefit from learning more talents and more reliable use of devices.

skill-search:15
skill-melee:8
skill-martial:3
skill-shoot:0
skill-throw:10
skill-dig:-5
desc:You're a sneaky sneak. A creepy creep. Stealth is your strength, and you can usually manage to bypass locks, avoid traps, discover loot and escape in the nick of time - eventually becoming so aware of your surroundings as to be entirely immune to traps. You're not a bad fighter but prefer lightweight melee and improvised thrown weapons, also being smart enough to be able to back that up with devices.

skill-melee:-5
skill-martial:-5
skill-shoot:-5
skill-throw:-5
skill-dig:-5
desc:You're a reluctant hero - "What, me? Run around all day in some slimy underground passages? Sounds awful." You would much rather take the load off in front of VaulTV. But the galaxy won't save itself, so here you are... You are sub-par in most ways but your inexperience gives you an improved experience modifier and an extra talent point. You will also find that you can take as long as you like to advance.

skill-dig:25
desc:Everyone says you're a bore but you must disagree and can indeed spend hours enumerating all the ways in which you must logically be a truly sparkling conversationalist, if only anyone would appreciate it... You aren't stealthy (you can't stop talking for long) but are used to evading thrown eggs and digging of course is a specialty.

skill-dig:0
desc:Karen and Dick are never wrong, ever. Just ask them. You are used to rushing in quickly and making your presence felt - aggravating everyone else, but you don't give a rodent's posterior about that. Your real talent though is your ability to yell until everyone respects your authority.

skill-throw:12
skill-dig:10
desc:Athletes have good physical abilities in general but are especially noted for speed. This personality is a good match for most classes, even ones where the penalties matter - as these characters are also the squishier ones, and benefit from being able to run away.

skill-dig:12
desc:You may save the galaxy while you are there - why not? - but your main motivation is cold, hard cash. There's loot down there and you want it! Your attentiveness to shiny things means you'll notice more of it - eventually being able to sense metal at a distance. But it also makes it harder for you to focus on anything else - skills other than searching and digging suffer.

skill-throw:5
skill-dig:5
desc:Your preferred reaction to danger is to run and hide like a chicken. This hurts your melee ability and doesn't make you very popular either. However, you do like the idea of fighting from 200 yards away, you are stealthy and you are used to running. Your survival instincts also give you a little more HP and AC.

desc:You are entirely fearless - making you an effective melee combatant but prone to failing to defend yourself, hence the reduced CON, hitdie and AC. Onward to the next adventure!

skill-throw:-30
skill-dig:-30
desc:Scrubs have no advantages, and a lot of disadvantages - poor stats, skills and hitpoints. They are a challenge personality - something to select if the usual game isn't tough enough for you. You get a 25% score bonus for accepting this challenge.

# This must be second to last in the personality section of the file, and must not be renamed, because of Split Personality choice.

skill-dig:30
desc:Munchkins get it easy. Exceptional starting items, huge bonuses to everything, fast leveling, and no penalties besides a whopping 90% off their final score - as this is of course an easy mode, and if you win as a Munchkin you should not brag too much about it. The Princess is in another castle...

# This must be last in the personality section of the file, and must not be renamed, because of Split Personality choice.
personality:Split
desc:Your personality changes unpredictably. Every level up a new personality develops at random. It is sometimes possible to avert this by an effort of will - but this isn't guaranteed and you often won't know what the alternative is. However, you will get better at this as you gain levels and wisdom, extreme personalities don't usually stick and you will be given free choice of personality if you reach maximum level.
book:[Split]
# spell:name:level:fail:exp:stat:hp:cooldown
spell:Personality:50:50:0:2:1d4:4d50
seffect:PERSONALITY:0:0:0
sdesc:Change your personality. All are available except Split itself, and Munchkin.


##### Extensions #####

ext:None
desc:A typical member of your race with nothing added or taken away - not a mutant, cyborg or other exotic variation.
 
ext:Mutant
stats:-1:-1:0:-1:-1:-3:0
hitdie:-15
exp:10
player-flags:REROLL_MUTATIONS
desc:You will begin with one or more mutations - which although they may have disadvantages are not purely negative. You'll gain at least one more mutation as you advance, and you'll gain the ability to exchange unwanted mutations for one that may be preferable - and eventually, to withstand radiation innately.

ext:Cyborg
talents:-3:0
exp:60:0
desc:You will begin with one or more cybernetic implants. These are varied and generally powerful, but having become used to your new abilities you have had less time for learning other things. So you have less talents available, and more experience is needed to advance - especially early on.

ext:Super
stats:1:0:0:1:3:1:0
hitdie:20
exp:100:50
desc:So you want to be a superhero - or a supervillain? You'll get the uniform, which has some abilities of its own. And as your powers manifest you'll gain some suitably thematic abilities - flight, X-ray vision, teleportation, laser eyes and torching your opponents may all be at your command. Dramatic tension unfortunately does require that superheroes have a hidden weakness, so watch out for that elfstone!

desc:The race with average abilities, from a human perspective at least. While you won't have bulletproof skin, X-ray vision or exotic abilities like that, there's a reason that it has primarily been humans who have colonized the galaxy - in a word, adaptability. That shows in the lowest experience requirement and the most specialization through talents.

values:RES_ELEC[-1]
desc:Sentient robots have been constructed for a variety of purposes and while artificial intelligence still isn't as good as the real thing, they have many advantages: a tough, fast metal body, precise aiming, rapid regeneration and IR vision. However, you can't easily gain talents, can't eat normal food and must avoid electric shocks.

obj-flags:SUST_CON | REGEN
desc:Time Lords take a human form, which changes when they regenerate. They can regenerate as many as 12 times, but it is always chancy - especially for the less experienced, and experience is not so easily gained (they have seen it all before). But spacetime is yours to command, with more tricks available as you advance, and that's the way to avoid needing to take that chance.

book:[Time-Lord]
# spell:name:level:fail:exp:stat:hp:cooldown
spell:Force Regeneration:25:22:40:2:2d4:1
seffect:FORCE_REGEN
sdesc:Forces your body into regeneration by an effort of will. This is just as chancy as regeneration at death is though, and failure means losing a regeneration as well as some brief but nasty side-effects.

spell:Time Loop:30:40:400:2:3d4:3d40
seffect:TIME_LOOP
sdesc:Put history into a strange loop, protected from external influences. This prevents the danger level from increasing for 12 days. This enormous effort comes at the cost of a regeneration, although should you fail to bind the loop you will not lose the regeneration.

# Blink ('warp'), a tp+speed, tp level, gain energy, movement speed, alter-reality?
