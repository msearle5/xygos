# === Understanding monster_interact.txt ===

# vs:<attacker>:<defender>

# An attacker or defender may be specified as:
# ! 				- Any monster
# <Monster Base>	- All monsters of that base
# <String>		    - All monsters containing that string
# !<Base or Mon>"   - Except that base or monster
#
# These are parsed in order, so that you could for example use:
# vs:ant:!
# vs:ant:!ant
# vs:black ant:red ant
# vs:red ant:black ant
# to mean "ants attack everything except other ants, with the exception
# that black and red ants will attack each other."
#
# Limits are added for attacking much more dangerous monsters.
# SMART monsters don't go for anything more than 9/7 their level, while
# non-STUPID ones don't go for anything more than 9/5 their level.
#
# UNIQUE monsters are more aggressive, because they are typically more
# powerful than others of their level (SMART = 11/7, non-STUPID 11/5).
# 
# Other monsters will never intentionally attack a UNIQUE, QUESTOR, 
# SPECIAL_GEN or rarity-0 monster.
