BUG: cleanup_angband() can't be run twice without running init_angband() between.
	Symptoms are "double free or corruption (!prev)", valgrind errors.
	Seen by duplicating the cleanup_angband() line in play_game(), killing a character and selecting "new game",
		or from the unit tests. If a init_angband() line is put between the two calls to cleanup_angband, the double free error isn't seen but a "Broken savefile - probably from a development version" is. The savefile can however be loaded again OK after restarting. (So something that influences how savefiles are read has not been reset? It's not z_info)
	Present in V (the memory corruption issue, by duplicating the line as above). Not in issues.
	Raised as V #5089

=> The obj structure was entirely 0 (including kind, which was the cause of the crash).
=> This was in Cyberspace (home quest), not having saved and restored while in that quest.
=> Suggesting random object generation is producing zeroes?
	- Added an assert for this.

BUG: clouded:  I'm way too strong early. At CL30 I have 380 HP, 150 AC, 5 BpR (with a dual darksaber so it's really 10), +17 speed and +2 movement speed. This is in part getting good loot and part monsters not being strong enough, I've been killing everything in one or two turns without getting scratched. Not sure how you want the power scaling compared to vanilla but so far monsters need some serious buffing!
	<This is though with the monsters-have-1-melee-blow problem>
	- Use incrementing autosave, to see how power changes with level?
		- (This has been added)
	- Be less generous with blows / round?
		- Calc_blows is now a tunable, and 30. May need more? See how this goes.

BUG: Once recalled back into a 1x1 hole in the rock in the top left (X4 Y4)
	!!! - this is presumably because sanitize_player_loc doesn't check that the point is connected to the >
		- could do this, but is there always a <?
		- Any in the right direction?
		- see "WIP" branch, but this won't work as is, and there's no way to repeat it

BUG: clouded:  Dark auras of grues should have some visual effect, it took me a while to notice they were lowering my light and weren't just invisible [ or a message? ]
  - Some but not all negative light monsters also have a dark cloud (commented out). This should look different - always unknown? But don't describe as "unknown grid" - it isn't.
  - Instead/plus "Everything around you dims/fades out."?
  - Treat it similarly to a cloud of vision blocking smoke?
	- although it doesn't block LOS, and so shouldn't replace (except momentarily?)
  - *** waiting until clouds are supported generally ***

BUG: Stores which close lose their entrance but don't become ruins. (Only when more than one would?)
	- UTR by setting turn directly to 1e8 and switching out and in of the town. It's probably a
	  symptom of another multitown bug, now fixed.

BUG: "failed!\n" twice from r_super.c (UTR going lev 1-26, Human Super Engineer) but seen in other circumstances
	- UTR - but given a more noticeable message

BUG: Crashed on exp gain as a Super Soldier
	- UTR

BUG: "Couldn't find artifact" warning because new char based on previous still had a player-made artifact
	- UTR

BUG: clouded (Windows):  Random crash when trying to start a character with the unknown talents perk: crash happened after pressing space to select it, doesn't always happen.
	- Not seen on Linux, or wine/winedbgm or Win10.

BUG: clouded:  Had a crash reading an unidentified
		- cash, etc. scroll on DL24 of the fortress, I'm guessing this was deep descent trying to take me below the quest level on DL25 but I haven't IDed it yet.
	- descent may be buggy (26->37), but this may be interaction with debug goto level.
	- security card gets "xygos: cmd-obj.c:430: use_aux: Assertion `effect' failed"
		- though this should never be found randomly
			- fixed.
	- The card crash is reading a "local acquisition" card (and the greater variety)
		- UTR, on Linux or Wine, or Win10

BUG: A Collective Skate that a cyborg started with was {??}
	UTR

BUG: If Triax is killed after all airports are destroyed, the game becomes unwinnable (as you can't go to the station)
		- Could rebuild if "Orbitable", only offering that destination. 
	Similarly if Triax is still alive and you are caught in a non-fortress town with its airport gone.
		- Send you when you reach the surface to Fortress-town?
		- Also don't offer flights to a town with no airport
	- Although the simplest way to handle this is just to never destroy airports.
WA (no destroy) 50a2319ecba71e68f429ac27b5d57d577815f8ab

BUG: "no position"
	This is a symptom of many possible other issues and hasn't appeared recently - best guess it was just a stale savefile
	from before an object change.

BUG: Gain a talent (e.g. Cavespeeder Pilot) and you (sometimes) end up Starving (0%)
	UTR easily (for watchpoints), probably bad save files

BUG: Lock up at start (occasionally)
	UTR easily, and is likely the (fixed?) shop filling bug

BUG?? - In quests, multiplying monsters are handled OK.
	But not newly spawned monsters that happen to be of the same type, or monsters removed through genocide or kill-body - and at least some of that could occur
	and could be fixed, although probably not in any quest currently in use.

BUG: "angband: gen-cave.c:2009: town_gen: Assertion `grid.x > 0' failed." (= the x,y are 0, 0.)
	- Can be triggered by Time Lord regeneration putting you in town, but has also been seen entering the town normally by <.
	As of 05904e9b066bb48a66f707a9bf4726182a27dc38 it no longer is easy (if possible at all) to
	trigger. A warning has been left in place.

	- This was seen, repeatably within a games, for all stores, with "Crazy River"/50m (L1)
		=> no "Stores" or other name (usual would be "Stores"/50m (L1)
	- Other 5 towns were Fortress, Caverns, Mine, Stores, Volcano, so this is Sewers.
	- It persists through save/load.
	This is (as expected) index 1 into t_info.
	Without having travelled to another town, all have xy=0,0.
	Flew to another town (2) and there were no complaints.
	Flew back and it moaned again.
	In another game though no problem with Sewers. (Or any other.)
	
	- possibly fixed by 904f0f5ccba3b6ff50ce44017726cda2feeb91a2 ?

	** related to the following? **

BUG: Saw climbing the stair into town put me in the middle of the level (not on a store, or the <)
	- is the search breaking the X loop, not the Y loop (gen-cave.c:1990)?
		- no.
	Assuming this is the same as the one above.

WontFix
=======

BUG: clouded:  Failing to use a gadget says "you failed to zap it"
	- cmd-obj.c, check_devices()
	- BAD. Gadgets=rods="z to zap", always referred to as zapping it. It is though confusing that wands are called 'zappers', and this could be improved by either a new verb for gadgets (used consistently), or a new name
	for wands (not 'zappers'), or perhaps even combining the two classes (gadgets and wands) - completely, or maybe
	just in the UI (both are zapped with 'z' but are otheriwse the same - displayed as different categories, etc.) 

BUG? Do small dungeons have a bottom at the right place? (You can jump past it)
	Yes. (No endboss, yet though)

BUG: Printers all seem to generate with {ignore}
	- Can't easily reproduce this

BUG: m-techniques top label is wonky (move the level 1 to the right, and the cost-label 2 to the left?)
	- Unable to reproduce with Spit Acid, Sprint.

Fixed
=====

BUG: "You knock out the MlM" -> "The MlM flees in terror!" -> "The MlM can move again" (after making a move!)

BUG: Running 50 simulations, Clearing, Yes to regeneration of Randarts:
	then immediately saving
	causes a corrupt savefile (number of kinds)
	Fixed (mostly) 96cfb9fae

BUG: clouded:  Monster list feedback: I assume you still have work planned but I felt like I was mostly fighting animals (and usually ones from V) which wasn't what I expected. The only dangerous monsters I've seen so far are Mecha-Triax (relatively appropriate in difficulty), shamblers (not too hard though, I killed one OOD around DL50), Cyberdemons (nasty), and Godzilla (nasty, haven't seen rPois at all). The other uniques I've ran into had much too few HPs. <This is also with the monsters-have-1-melee-blow problem>
	- lack of rPois is a problem. Stats suggest l55. Basically you need to get lucky and find an artifact, there are no other base item sources (there are egos). Add a green cape? (Fume hood, visor, suit etc.) and some egos?
	- There is now much more rPois.

BUG? Stuff isn't transported when you fly - should it be? Should there just be 1 house?
	- see also -
BUG: clouded:  Towns having different houses is a bit of an inconvenience when it costs money to travel between towns. Perhaps it's better to just have a single house? (Pay?)
	- Unless inventories are unlimited, that must cope with the possibility of not having enough space
	- Also limits the possibilities of homes/home expansion as a quest reward, though home-unlock quests would
		work (which could be kill-the-X quests like ToME, but they could be granted for other reasons. It would
		have to be accessible to most characters at the first approach, though.)
	- option?
	- branched, homequests
	- Fixed by merge of this branch 782c765b311a226562ee3d2a58c6f438bcaa6f16

BUG: Shop owners (store_do_fight()) are always male
	- would need to split first into 2/3
	fIXED

BUG: Probably printers should be more restricted in what they can make
	- [UN]PRINTABLE flag?
		- cash, etc.
		- also special items for quests, artifact bases etc. 
			- anything with 0 generation or QUEST_SPECIAL or SPECIAL_GEN
	- also should describe better (cards, etc)?

BUG: activate coronet: "You activate it. the Coronet of the Core pulses a soft white" (the should be The)
	Fixed e70284c0b

BUG: Badly named: "an universal detector" - there is no way to infer a/an reliably from spelling alone, so would have to add a flag (such as a leading character).
	Fixed 32413b0f7

BUG: clouded:  Cyber augments are a cool idea but legs seem way too overpowered. Movement speed is a really strong ability, I think you should reduce the effectiveness of a pval of it if you want it to be common. I don't think the player should ever get more than +2 permanent move speed (without some downside). Arm implants don't seem too strong. I only upgraded on my plain +3 int brain implant when I found a telepathy one after DL90. Implants in general sell for a ton without costing anything to implant / remove.
	Move speed has been put on a curve, in the same way speed is. A $ and time cost has been added to install/remove.

BUG: backwardsEric (Mac): Xcode's leak checker reported some leaks. Here's the ones from loading an existing character:

    Memory allocated by string_make() in player_quests_reset() is leaked (6 allocations; 2.05 KiB total).
    Memory allocated by mem_zalloc() in parse_flavor_flavor() is leaked (239 allocations; 48 bytes apiece; 11.2 KiB total).
    Memory allocated by string_append() in parse_flavor_flavor() is leaked (236 allocations; 6.36 KiB total).
    Memory allocated by string_make() in insert_string() (called by flavor_init()) is leaked (59 allocations; 16 bytes apiece; 944 bytes total).
    Memory allocated by mem_realloc() in insert_string() (call by flavor_init()) is leaked (1 allocation; 512 bytes total).
		- Probably. Several memory leaks have been fixed, it's not clear whether they are the same ones

BUG: clouded:  It's easily missable that you can press Q in stores to look for a quest
	- the difference between that and the other store specials is that it varies from one shop to another and
	  over time. So a notification (message (the first time that you have visited a store after it changed) or something in the store UI, or both) makes sense - more than just making the
	  doc more obvious (putting it in the scrolltext or a ToMElike readme card)

BUG: user.prf needs to be updated with races, classes, persos, extens.

BUG: clouded:  When using a printer with plastic blocks there are so many items it goes off the screen. Needs to scroll or have categories
	- The fluff says it should, but it doesn't work - It updates the cursor position, but not the display.
	- Fixed 82b272ced

BUG: clouded PLAYER is at physical 99, effective 108. Max 100. But danger is described as 'modest' (2) - display bug?
	(titles rather than levels?)

BUG: stats mode 1,2 is broken (all zeroes), 3 at least works.
	(TODO add 5, for item types and value? (Add value to diving?))
		- easier to add to 1/2. If this can be fixed.

BUG: "a sensor dark helmet" is being generated (Clouded) CL46 dump, "on the floor in a pit at l59"

BUG: clouded:  When a hologram monster gazes at me there is a message "ERROR: Effect handler not found for SOUND."
	Fixed

BUG: clouded:  Matrix bugs are imbalanced, too easy to get tons of good potions
	146bc0498

BUG: clouded:  Firing a gun not at a monster results in the bullet falling to the floor and being able to be picked up again - sometimes this results in a crash
	** - Seen, sometimes with "breaks" and no crash in the town on Linux/X
	Fixed

BUG: On Windows, there is no file menu and a "General Store" error - caused by tiles.
	Should probably just remove tiles - but not the menu. (V can use the menu without tiles.)
	Fixed bcf9adb5f

BUG: "level X of the fortress" in hiscores: not the actual dungeon (which was the Caverns)

BUG: "You fail to the tengu" (+ red worm mass - when you attack it with a pocket knife)
	- Also seen in the town lake, with an electric eel, and on Fortress 20 with a boa.
	24c6c11b6

BUG: Bombs (e.g. pineapple) give excess messages - "The X fails to harm the Y." "The X detonates!" "The Y screams!".
	The first should be removed. 
	aeb9b254c9a2aae28dab15baa2d31b3aad8bafcd 

BUG:/home/msearle/rogl/angband/v-xygos/angband/src/xygos: Error in flag_on(lore->flags, b->resist_flag): FlagID[0] Size[11] FlagOff[4294967295] FlagBV[128]
	(Hit a lizard with a laser knife)
	(flagID 0 = illegal, 1 is the first allowed.)
	- does every brand need a resist-flag?
	Certainly all previously have
	Fixed

BUG: Armoury and Magic Shop need renaming. And possibly BM.
	Fixed

BUG: An artifact granting protection from blindness stopped a blindness pill from taking effect even
		when it was only carried in the pack.
	Fixed e1ca0fcc9731cd7ba205fec040c0ef4c5c4e64e8

BUG: Pilot with Caveracer still displays Cavespeeder as an available to take talent
	Fixed 4e5082356

BUG: "hologram nonliving creature" in monster info should just be "hologram".
	Fixed 1bd14dc1050161d11f17841d03f3271da27f5afc

BUG: "But not by buying stuff and selling it back again" checks origin. This stops buy-selling something that originated in the store, but not something that you found. (So add a 'once sold' flag? Or just vanish the item)

BUG: Starting characters can get a scrap of flesh - require cost > 0, for random?
BUG: May be no lights/food in the gs

BUG: Random artifacts (e.g. Slick's 6mm rifle) can be generated with no flags.
	Fixed 20080606a2d0f713a57b5025135527bba8f3a1f

BUG: Random arts can be Coronets - though prob in .txt is 0

BUG: C-screen displays melee tohit when no weapon of 0, not martial.
	(missing skills from class etc)

BUG: INT is over-valued in automatic stat assignment (e.g. a Wrestler got 50 points in INT, only 3 in DEX)
	Fixed

BUG: Delete the savefile, make a new character, check a store's name.
	  Save, reload. The store name will sometimes have changed.
	  Save, reload again and it won't.
	  It does this with or without random names being used for that store,
	  although it has only been tested with the random name diff in place.
	  Doesnt happen with a newly rolled char, only a 'based on last' - and the name is then the same as the previous character.
		world.c:world_init_towns(): shuffle(geog, sizeof(geog) / sizeof(*geog)); triggers it. (Remove this and it's OK)
		This function is not called though except at start.
		Fixed 904f0f5ccba3b6ff50ce44017726cda2feeb91a2

BUG: "You failed to concentrate hard enough" may be inappropriate. Per spell?
		- with a default per primary stat? With concentrate for INT.
	Fixed 43b6afaf3f89f4ed34fa534e77043fd23bb68bff

BUG: Ranged attacks from gadgets and pills (at least) hit yourself. Bolts hurt, balls/breaths don't.
	Or at other times it aims at a fixed point (0,0?) This is the same whether using a dir key or a target.
	Fixed 6b94c16e257ea1b52c448e991354d7112cf34c52

BUG: On Wine, if no name is given then the character is nameless (in the scores, at least)
	(This is as V.) (Use a random shk first name?) (See existing '* for a random name')

BUG: Quaffing pills
	- one way to go would be to remove all references in the text to quaffing, make pills targets for eating, but keep the quaff command around as a shortcut and for finger memory.
	Fixed: ed4d2f1faaf6610e9efc1b365291ae75c3503655

BUG: When in Giant Form (from a snozzcumber) you can't eat. Or quaff. Quaffing prompts to to change back. (Reasonably for some forms, not really for this - is there a flag? If not, one could be added)
	- There seems to be nothing preventing you staying in giant form. But you do need to eat.
	- There should be a timeout anyway - fast hunger? (Androids can't do this anyway, at least for as long as the only way to take giant form is by eating something)
=> OTOH only eating from the floor is consistent with not being able to get at your pack, so it's OK as long as the messages aren't misleading.
	WontFix

=>	Eating just says that you don't have any food (wrong!)
	Fixed 810ebb5906360c9344c6ddced0c77e5024879db9

=>	You also can't use shops ("scream"), which is generally OK but should it be possible to use ones you own, or the home? For consistency (you can't drop items on the ground, so why allow use of your home?) this is OK. The message is still out, though - there's nobody at home to scream.
	- It might be reasonable to say (given that most of the existing forms in shape.txt won't be used) that any form is either too big or awkwardly shaped to fit through the door, or unable to operate a lock / doorknob. For the moment, assume a giant is the only big one (anything more general should wait until there are more examples being used).
	- (So why isn't this true of the shops? Well IRL shops have unlocked / open / automatic doors which may be bigger that your average front door - the scream message is worth keeping, anyway.)
	Fixed 810ebb5906360c9344c6ddced0c77e5024879db9

=>
	- Turn back when below 50% health? And/or a CON check.
	- Or just treat being transformed as another timed counter?
	- HP might be an interestingly different mechanic, though. There are a lot of timed effects
		already and they can be too predictable. A per-turn chance based non-linearly on HP would
		make more sense than a flat 50%, though.
	- Fixed e90a3e850e7f7583cfb28e486dc819c7e5ec0552

BUG: clouded:  Killing white horrors can cause the other horrors to get placed invisibly. They can't be seen or hit, but saving causes them to appear.
	Fixed ef28d4e0b

BUG: Tourists' starting sun hat (resLight) isn't rune-IDed
	- That might be reasonable. But the battery the tourist started with is also unIDed. It becomes IDed mysteriously later.
	- Similar symptoms if they start with a wax candle.
		- which is {??}. Wielding doesn't change it. Using an ID card on it produces no message but removes the ??.
	- Is there something about start items (and wiz-command created?), like having no known object, that is different from normal creation?
		- Still occurs after 416ff90a18e92ba95db126ffd717488548a88762
		- But only partly. The hat is unIDed, but reading ID on it behaves as expected.
		- Is an ID loop similar to the shop, used on start items, a good idea?
			- Yes, given that it is done right. See object_know_all().

BUG: clouded:  Using roguelike keys, when in look mode "k" direction doesn't work

BUG: backwardsEric (Mac): I didn't run into any severe problems running Xygos on a Mac (11.5.1; self-compiled). There's a cosmetic issue in the point allocation at birth: the line giving the total points allocated overlaps with the saving throw display on the character sheet making it more difficult to read. Perhaps a bit of clearing before and after the total would help?
	- Seen on Linux. Move right column down?
	Fixed

BUG: "
		- Light, with the rune being "use energy" or "light"?
			- Is this a problem? It's IDed on buying it. Other stuff doesn't behave like that, though...
	e.g. "a tactical flashlight (RTG Mod) (charging) {??}" in the store
		- The same thing can be made up with play-with-object, and it behaves the same way.
		- Also rune-ID fails silently on these objects
		- May only happen on wiz-command generated items
		- Still occurs after 416ff90a18e92ba95db126ffd717488548a88762
		- Also partly fixed: on buy it is IDed as "use energy".
		- Pre-ID (like combat runes)?
		- Fixed 39b7b5351cb93c6902f8e423e5f67e89ec4e51cb

BUG: Lights are using wrong descriptions?
	- New game. Create with debug option a stick of dynamite. It appears unIDed (e.g. striped) but has the description of a known flare and behaves like one too.
	- "wax candle" gives "cybernetic..fast running..speed" i.e. the one before it.
	- "firecracker" (the next) has the description of a wax candle
		- it lasts for 15 turns (like a firecracker) but "goes out" rather than exploding (like a candle).
		- ones generated by "All Lights" are the same.
	- It's off by 1, is this just the debug mode & is it just lights?
		- It's only flavored lights (a disposable flashlight is OK, so is a life pill)
	- Note that other flavored items don't have any description besides "It can be drunk" when created by debug option. This is how lights should be.
	- Could it be the object.txt or flavor.txt?
	- must be MIMIC_KNOW = one before!
	Fixed: 9afdfcfa7e44790941d902bff767ecaddc7b7f93

BUG: Pile integrity failure (firecracker, which was held by a monster when it went off)

BUG: The starting town was once "Smokey R8". Getting 99999999 gold got it renamed to Smokey R89999.
	In another game with ok start, one of the other town names  had a corrupt last

BUG: Resists screen is >80 wide (Also, the per-slot stats only label only displays a to l)
	Remove ':' lines?
	Currently the second screen retains the Name..HP and sum-stats blocks. Would removing them help? (A third screen is another option)
	Would want to retain the stat labels if this is done (or move them to the left of the slot-stats)
	This might result in a 3, not 4 column display. Giving 26 not 19 chars (plus the intermediate blanks), enough for a few more in both description and slots.
	But will there end up with more, or less slots? Rings and amulets will disappear. OTOH, a form with more slots might appear...
	Adapting to large terminals is also a possibility, but can't be the only way to play.
	So best to leave alone for now?

	Almost all from death_knowledge->player_learn_all_icons->player->learn_icon->update_player_object_knowledge->player_learn_icon->object_fully_known->object_icons_known->object_non_fault_icons_known->icon_index.
	There are 112 calls to player_learn_icon (expected, that many icons)
